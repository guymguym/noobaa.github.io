<div>Starting from NooBaa V2, the system includes <a href="https://noobaa.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2921822-bucket-spillover">bucket spillover</a>&nbsp;which can be used for testing and as a temporary storage.<br />
<br />
In order to move ahead and build a scalable system, the first step would be introducing storage resource to your NooBaa system.<br />
<br />
This step is required for writing and reading data.<br />
<br />
There are two types of storage resources in NooBaa:<br />
&nbsp;</div>

<div>1. Linux or Windows server with more than 15GB free storage. <strong>You will need at least three servers, each with at least 15GB free storage.</strong>&nbsp;</div>

<div>2. A native cloud storage, such as AWS S3 bucket or Azure Blob storage.<br />
<br />
Once you have the resources in place, connect an application and start working.<br />
<br />
Adding Linux or Windows servers can be done from the main screen, by clicking on the<a href="https://noobaa.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2852040-install-nodes-?t=775839"> </a><strong><a href="https://noobaa.desk.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2852040-install-nodes-?t=775839">Install Nodes </a>button</strong></div>
Follow the wizard instructions, copy the one-liner and run it on each of the three servers.<br />
