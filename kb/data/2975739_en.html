By default, NooBaa is running data rebuild operations (moving data between different nodes).<br />
If you wish to set the system to a temporary state of maintenance and prevent high-level data rebuilding, turn on maintenance mode for the needed period of time.<br />
This is specifically useful for storage nodes maintenance activities such as OS updates, network changes, etc.<br />
To switch into maintenance mode, navigate to System Management-&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Maintenance<br />
