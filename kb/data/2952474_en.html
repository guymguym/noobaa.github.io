<div class="p1"><span class="s1">Regions in NooBaa is a location tag.<br />
The regions configuration allows customers to associate resources with location.<br />
Associate a region with location helps to&nbsp;improve performance by setting locality awareness while taking data placement decision and reading data. In addition, using regions is another way to reduce egress costs due to locality awareness during data consumption activities.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p class="p1"><span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>How does it work?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<p class="p1">Resources within the same region will be prioritized for data assignments and for serving read requests.<br />
Using a local endpoint in this region will benefit the proximity to the local resources by reading and writing the data directly from local resources, if possible, and mirror data to a remote location after achieving the required resiliency level locally.&nbsp;<br />
Another example is using an endpoint in the cloud provider network, and associate both the endpoint and the cloud resource in NooBaa with a region, so applications that run in the cloud would use the right endpoint to avoid redundant&nbsp;egress cost.&nbsp;</p>
