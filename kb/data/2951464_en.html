<div>NooBaa performance may vary from one environment to another.&nbsp;<br />
In some cases, specific applications require faster performance which can be easily addressed by scaling S3 endpoints.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The S3 endpoint is a service that every NooBaa core provides by default, and it handles all the heavy lifting data digestion in NooBaa. The endpoint service handles the data chunking, deduplication, compression, and encryption and accept data placement instructions from NooBaa core.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NooBaa daemon can provide two type of services:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Storage service - enabled by default</li>
	<li>S3 endpoint service - disabled by default.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div>Deploying S3 endpoint actually consists of:</div>

<ol>
	<li>Deploying NooBaa daemon as close as possible to the application</li>
	<li>Enable S3 endpoint&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Open the firewall&nbsp;for inbound TCP ports 80 and 443.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
