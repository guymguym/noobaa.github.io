<h1>Introduction</h1>
This document will guide you through NooBaa system setup and assumes that the user has an existing understanding of NooBaa architecture and functionality.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
<h3>Setup includes the following high-level steps:</h3>
1. <strong>NooBaa Core deployment</strong> - A virtual machine that includes NooBaa core server with a management console. This virtual machine also includes a default S3 REST gateway.<br />
2. <strong>[Optional] Daemon installation and distribution</strong> - Daemon software is required for every storage node that takes part in the storage network. This software is available for download from the virtual machine, as well its unique configuration used for authentication.<br />
3. <strong>S3 storage client </strong>- In order to use NooBaa Object Storage, S3 client is required. The S3 client connects to the S3 REST gateway, which by default resides on the virtual machine and allows upload/download objects.
