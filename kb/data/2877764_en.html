When adding a new storage node, you may see it as an offline node, with &quot;No Access&quot; issue (see the image below).<br />
<br />
The first step to troubleshooting such case is to check the firewall settings on this node.<br />
<br />
Additional information about the ports setup can be found in the following <a href="https://noobaa.desk.com/customer/portal/articles/2866081-minimum-requirements-for-system-installation">article</a><br />
<br />
Please make sure that the ports range of 60100-60600 is open for inbound traffic. These ports are used to communicate between the storage nodes to allow an efficient self-healing behavior.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once you verified that the ports are open, please navigate to the node -&gt; Test &amp; Diagnostics and click on &quot;Run Test&quot; button. This test will run connectivity test and it should pass if the firewall is configured correctly.&nbsp;<br />
